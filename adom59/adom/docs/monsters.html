<tr><td>0</td><td>goblin</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="goblin" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/0.png"></td><td>Nasty goblins! This grungy little humanoid would much rather hide under a rock than fight you. He cowers in fear at your drawn weapon, and flees so he can bully some weaker creature.<br><br>A small filthy creature, closely related to the orcs but much weaker. Goblins are even worse cowards than orcs.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>1</td><td>orc</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="orc" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/1.png"></td><td>'Beauty won't help you to survive, strength and toughness will!' Something like this must have crossed Gruumsh's mind when he created the race called orcs. The pig-faced orcs live in an extremely harsh environment. When there are no enemies to be fought they fight each other. This selection combined with their fast reproduction rate makes orcs one of the strongest and most diverse humanoid race known. Yet, they are as wild and (most of them) primitive and stupid as they are strong. That stopped them from being a real threat to civilization in general. They tend to wear everything they can lay their hands on.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>2</td><td>large bat</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="large bat" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/2.png"></td><td>A loud twitter from above... a confusing fluttering of leathery wings... the large bat swoops down from the sky gibbering and shrieking. This brownish bat is roughly one yard from wingtip to wingtip, and has a face only its mother could love. Normally placid browsers on fruit and slime molds, many Drakalor bats are rabid and quite aggressive.<br><br>It looks like a small dog that has grown wings. Large brown eyes cautiously follow your every move. These animals only eat fruit, but if they feel disturbed by an intruder, they will try to drive away the source of disturbance by flapping their wings and clawing with the legs.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>3</td><td>giant rat</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="giant rat" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/3.png"></td><td>These huge rodents eat almost anything, and will quickly gnaw through a humanoid limb to drag it to its burrow for itself or its young. Like other rodents, they must constantly chew in order to wear away their front teeth, which never stop growing. While not greatly feared by most adventurers, they can be dangerous to the less experienced, especially if encountered in a swarm or in a diseased state.<br><br>From a distance, you mistook it for a medium-sized short-legged dog, but as you get a closer look you can't help but notice the rodent teeth, the clawed feet and the long naked tail and deeply regret you've come this close. Its gray-brown fur is soaked in dirty water and oil and some clumps seem to be crusted with blood. It regards you without a trace of fear and edges closer, maybe hoping for you to drop it a crust of bread, maybe hoping to get away with biting some of your toes off.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>4</td><td>hobgoblin</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="hobgoblin" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/4.png"></td><td>An average sized humanoid, looking like the smaller cousin, the goblin, with the same disdaining sneer but stretched upwards a bit and given a little more muscle. Hobgoblins have a bad attitude and could cause trouble to those of lesser stature or smaller mind.<br><br>Albeit longer and stronger than a goblin, it doesn't stand much higher, as its knuckles scrape on the ground as it walks. Its leathery wrinkled skin complements the dirty long claws on the filthy paws rather well.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>5</td><td>kobold</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="kobold" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/5.png"></td><td>A demented little creature that looks like a cross between a malnourished goblin and a small, yappy dog. Most other Ancardian races view kobolds as semi-sentient vermin, and treat them accordingly. Kobolds, for their part, do nothing to dispel this view...<br><br>Ugh! You feel as if you're getting fleas just looking at it! This dirty and foul smelling little dog-faced kobold stands about 3 feet, covered in filthy ochre-brown fur, wearing naught but an uncured hide as armor. It appears very canine indeed, with a long snout constantly testing the air, and perky ears that search for the sounds of the enemy. It yelps occasionally in nervous anger, clutching a very crude bow in one hand. Bearing its tiny fangs, it scratches at a random itch on its body. You now wish you had taken that bar of complementary soap from the inn...</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>6</td><td>rabid dog</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="rabid dog" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/6.png"></td><td>The very definition of lesser beasts, this powerful canine's brain has been nearly destroyed by the ravages of a painful disease. Its dark fur is matted, and frothy saliva drips from its mouth. It moves wildly, attacking anything that draws its attention away from its own suffering.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>7</td><td>wild cat</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="wild cat" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/7.png"></td><td>A fairly large gray cat with black markings. It looks so furry and cute you just wanna pet it; too bad it's got claws like fishhooks and is spitting in fury. It comes knee high to you, with a very furry face and no tail, much like the common lynx. It shouldn't be that much of a problem unless your back is turned...</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>8</td><td>skeleton</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="skeleton" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/8.png"></td><td>The weakest of the undead forms, only the bones of these beings were recalled to do the bidding of a master. They have almost no intelligence and so attack anything that lives, venting their hatred at the interruption of their eternal peace.<br><br>A humanoid skeleton of half-decayed yellowish brown bones. It seems to crumble as it moves in a jerky walk. Some unholy magic made these ancient remains of a dead person get up once again, to fight any living being they encounter as a mindless puppet of the evil that will not let them rest.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>9</td><td>giant frog</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="giant frog" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/9.png"></td><td>Slick skinned, big mouthed, web-footed amphibians that hop about and snatch meals from a distance with a sticky, front-hinged tongue. They swallow opponents whole when not hopping onto them or knocking them about with the muscular tongue.<br><br>Now you have an idea of how a fly feels when a frog looks at it. This amphibian is almost as large as you, and it looks as though it wants to fight you. You don't know how it'll attack, but it could make you smash into the wall simply by jumping into you.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>10</td><td>giant ant worker</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="giant ant worker" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/10.png"></td><td>A glistening black insect scurrying about in constant motion. Two long antennae search the area for movement. Its small pincers are more suited for digging and carrying than combat, yet appear menacing nonetheless.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>11</td><td>giant ant warrior</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="giant ant warrior" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/11.png"></td><td>A large six-legged black insect with a red underbelly. Its large mandibles taper to a sharp point, and barbs on its front legs are as dangerous as any spear. A stinger at the tip of its abdomen completes the ant's arsenal.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>12</td><td>giant ant queen</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="giant ant queen" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/12.png"></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>A massive winged ant with an engorged abdomen. Significantly larger than the other ants, it's quite upset at what you've done to the colony. If segmented eyes can portray bloodlust, you see it here.</td>
<tr><td>13</td><td>gnoll</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="gnoll" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/13.png"></td><td>Before you looms a grotesque hybrid of man and hyena called a gnoll. This one stands nearly seven feet tall. Well known for both bestial strength and uncanny cunning, the gnoll is feared and loathed by civilized races.<br><br>A terrifying humanoid hybrid, it looks like a large goblin with long yellow-brown fur and the teeth of a hyena. It snarls at you and advances, swinging a large ugly axe.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>14</td><td>kobold shaman</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="kobold shaman" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/14.png"></td><td>A magic-using kobold? Shocking! How such a simple creature could grasp anything more complicated than tying a boot is beyond you. But as you gaze upon the gnarled form of this kobold, you sense that it is not as stupid as you might think. It has cold and possessed eyes, and a canine rage consumes its features. Its tiny frame is swathed in a rough cloth robe, covered in strange and primitive arcane sigils which are probably readable only by the shaman itself. A myriad of simple charms, bags, carved bones and other strange findings hang from its belt. It seems as if the shaman draws upon its magical power directly from the earth and air around him, as blue energy surges from the ground and crackles about its body, twisting into shapes that resemble the angry faces of long dead kobolds. Still, it bleeds just as the others do...<br><br>Hopping and jumping in a ceremonial dance, a very small humanoid screams a kind of song, but he definitely can't sing. He also seems to get most of the words wrong: one moment, a few erratic raindrops fall from the ceiling, the next the singer is lifted half an inch off the ground, then a pebble on the floor grows some moss. Suddenly a tiny raincloud appears above your head and a very small bolt of lightning strikes you, slightly burning your forehead.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>15</td><td>hobgoblin leader</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="hobgoblin leader" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/15.png"></td><td>This fellow seems to have a bit more authority than most of the hobgoblins. He carries an air of leadership about him, supported by a small  and slightly built frame topped by a pointy-eared noggin. A hooked nose sprouts from between two beady red eyes. His complexion is like a piece of uncured meat left out in the sun, tough and green. Mismatched armor looks and fits a bit better than most of his tribe's, and his face seems to have seen a few fights. This manages very well, you think, to make him look even uglier. Of particular interest is the string of various fingers, ears, toes, and other extremities around his neck, which doubtlessly were taken as mementos from previous encounters. He sees you as just another necklace...</td><td>Endowed with a presence not possessed by most of the other hobgoblins, this one stands out as one of the more capable of the tribe. She stands a bit taller, with a slightly more defined physique complemented by a not-so-sickly green complexion. Her wide ears point defiantly, her nose turns down, tapering to a point, and her eyes pierce like bloody knives. Possessing several scars on various parts of her body, she's seen her share of battle. This is also evident in her armor, which, while looking and fitting better than usual for a hobgoblin, still seems as though it should fall apart. Crude jewelry decorates her, ranging from iron rings in her ears and nose, to a string of teeth across her neck. Overall, not as repulsive as most of the males, but you wouldn't want to trade beauty secrets...</td>
<tr><td>16</td><td>zombie</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="zombie" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/16.png"></td><td>Called back from the dead, these creatures arise shortly after death to serve a master until their still rotting bodies decay beyond usefulness. They feed upon the living by consuming living flesh.<br><br>A corpse raised by dark magic. It is completely mindless and thus knows neither pain nor fear. It's often ordered to do work for those who control it, but sometimes it is also commanded to fight, although it isn't really good at it.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>17</td><td>orc scorcher</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="orc scorcher" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/17.png"></td><td>Scorchers are fast traveling raiders, who leave nothing but death and destruction in their wake. Fear is their most effective weapon, so they paint their faces, bodies, armor and banners in garish colors with gruesome pictures spelling doom! The life devoted to killing, raping and rampaging has left its mark on their minds. Don't try to reason with a scorcher.<br><br>Wearing only light armor and light weapons, this orcish fighter prefers to strike quickly and surprisingly. Their gangs will attack a settlement in the middle of the night, try to slay some inhabitants and steal some goods and immediately turn to flee as soon as they meet resistance, setting fire to buildings as they retreat. They rarely collect much loot, but often they cause massive destruction.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>18</td><td>giant bat</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="giant bat" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/18.png"></td><td>This nightly predator and larger cousin of the common cave bat can be easily distinguished by its light gray color. Although they are difficult to hit sometimes, a single strike or two should fell this critter. In some countries they are roasted over open fire as a delicacy, usually served with sweet potatoes and garlic sauce.<br><br>These overgrown flying mammals attack by biting, using their exquisite hearing to guide them toward their opponent. They are hardier than they first appear, as their leathery wings and thick fur provide more protection than most would expect from such a nimble flier.<br><br>Hey, that's almost fun! A bat with the wingspan of an eagle dropped on your head, covering it like a cape. But what's that scratching feeling? Can it be...? With a disgusted shout, you hurl the animal away. It really tried to bite you, in spite of having weak, soft teeth. You're determined to teach that pest a lesson.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>19</td><td>huge bat</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="huge bat" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/19.png"></td><td>With a weird skirling cry, the huge bat flies swiftly down from the sky like a gigantic manta ray of the air. This bat's velvety black wings stretch a full two meters across, and its eyes glow red with insanity as it flutters nearer and nearer on its darting, erratic path.<br><br>Dust on the floor rises in the wind caused by immense leathery wings which carry a dog-sized body covered with mottled black fur. Large transparent ears twitch and keen jet-black eyes fix on you as the broad snout opens baring clean white teeth creating a strange contrast to the otherwise completely black shape. You wonder what a bat eats to become so large...</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>20</td><td>giant bee queen</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="giant bee queen" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/20.png"></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>This over-sized insect, unique to each hive is the source of all the other bees in a given hive. Only if the hive is greatly threatened will she remove her bloated self from the hive's egg chambers to defend her children.<br><br>A large bloated bee. She won't easily leave the hive, for she is the one who has to make sure that new bees can hatch. If she comes out to fight someone attacking her children, this is a last ditch effort, and she's likely to be extremely angry, too.</td>
<tr><td>21</td><td>giant bee warrior</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="giant bee warrior" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/21.png"></td><td>Larger and fiercer than the worker variety of these giant insects, warrior bees are more aggressive and pack a deadlier poison than the generic workers, but also defend the hive at a great price, as once their poison is delivered by the huge stinger, the bee will soon die.</td><td>A rather young bee, still at the peak of her strength. She protects the hive against all foes that may attack, and as soon as one of their sisters is hurt or killed or the hive is disturbed, all the fighters will make ready to fight the enemy at the cost of their lives. For their barbed sting will stay in the wound when they hit, causing nasty wounds, but losing the sting will also cause the bee to die almost instantly.</td>
<tr><td>22</td><td>giant bee worker</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="giant bee worker" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/22.png"></td><td>A huge insect with yellow and black markings, these normally secure pollen for the hive, fighting only when the hive is threatened. Normally involved in food gathering, they will aggressively attack any who have been aggressive toward the hive, or who infringe upon the hive's territory. Like all bees, they die if their stinger is removed.<br><br>You've learned that bees frequent blossoms of flowers and trees to collect nectar and pollen, but what bees make their honey from in the middle of a dimly lit dungeon is anyone's guess. The older bees that aren't ferocious enough anymore to defend the hive as fighters collect whatever they want, and are normally peaceful. If they feel threatened, however, they will fight, even if it costs their lives.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>23</td><td>ogre</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="ogre" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/23.png"></td><td>These large humanoids are strong and not very bright. They tend toward patchy hair and vacuous looks, and favor caves and mountainous regions, only occasionally living in a larger settlement with others of their ilk. They are bad-tempered and enjoy plucking appendages off smaller creatures.<br><br>So large he has to stoop over to get through a door, a large naked humanoid grins at you. This creature wears various bones as ornaments, and you have a good idea of what happened to the previous owners of these bones.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>24</td><td>bugbear</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="bugbear" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/24.png"></td><td>The monster of the night parents speak of in stories to scare their children. Man-sized and covered in matted black hair and with glowing yellow eyes. Its mouth is stretched in a permanent grimace, showing off rows upon rows of bone-white sharp teeth and an ever-present stream of drool.<br><br>And you thought your parents were just joking when they told you about nasty fur-covered beasts lurking in dark places, eating the bugs attracted by dirt. You see a heap of moth-eaten fur, the only distinct features being broad sharp claws and a mass of needle-like teeth.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>25</td><td>animated tree</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="animated tree" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/25.png"></td><td>While all trees are alive, these are especially noted for being mobile as well. These protectors of the woods look exactly like normal trees, except when they shamble about on mobile root stubs, or swing branches down upon the enemies of the wood. Thick bark and flexible limbs are possessed by all, regardless of the species of tree an individual may resemble.<br><br>These creatures generally dwell in forests and seem to possess attributes of both plant and animal. Though it has leaves and bark, it can move and swing its branches at amazing speed, especially when fighting.<br><br>Green light filters through the leaves and the air is fresher around this being. The long branches move slowly, although the air is still, and the roots lift themselves from the stone and bore into the ground in another location. All these motions take place in a perfectly natural grace, as if all trees were meant to behave like this and the forests on the surface have only forgotten the art of walking. The trunks here stand so thick that you fear you might get stuck between them and crushed as the trees move. For a moment you think about setting fire to the broken twigs and dead leaves on the floor in the hope of driving the trees away, but such plants could easily stamp out a fire as well as the person that started it.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>26</td><td>fire beetle</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="fire beetle" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/26.png"></td><td>This dark red insect is a regular hazard for those who venture into the earth. Steam rises from within its rock-hard carapace. Its infernal temperament makes it quick to anger, although it may be relatively complacent after feeding on a hapless adventurer.<br><br>The overall shape of this beetle resembles that of the scarabaeus, only its size is slightly wrong: you haven't seen many beetles the size of a pony so far. It radiates warmth like a small oven, and its exoskeleton appears to be hardened by the heat: the sharp strong mandibles shine in the torchlight, reminding you of scissor-blades.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>27</td><td>giant centipede</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="giant centipede" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/27.png"></td><td>This overgrown arthropod rarely has exactly one hundred legs, as several have usually been lost while converting victims into meals. They attack with multiple legs seeking to hold their prey for a poisonous bite. Several different colors have been reported and they are rumored to be the larval form of some other, more fearsome beast.<br><br>This centipede is so large that you can precisely follow the intricate motions of the multitude of legs as they move the long body with its chitinous plates. The mouth displays three strong saw-toothed jaws, a dark liquid glinting on the tips of the teeth.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>28</td><td>lizard man</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="lizard man" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/28.png"></td><td>The race of lizard men is not well understood, but combines a humanoid body with the head and skins of lizards. They and Drakelings both deny any relation between their races, but the lizard men fight members of most other races with fierce enthusiasm.<br><br>A reptilian creature who walks on two legs and has learnt to use tools and weapons. Its eyes show little intelligence and the thin forked tongue gives it a serious speech impediment.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>29</td><td>large spider</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="large spider" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/29.png"></td><td>These large arachnids stand a couple of feet tall with a leg span of several feet. Like most spiders, they attack with a poisonous bite, waiting for the poison to sufficiently weaken the opponent for storage or consumption. They prefer dark areas and corners from which to surprise passing victims.<br><br>These are rather large and aggressive arachnids with a diameter of about 6 feet. This one is searching carefully for its next meal.<br><br>A giant arachnid blocks your way, and you can study its anatomy much more closely than you desired. The stigmata on the abdomen are as large as human palms, the strong hairy legs barely thinner than your arms and the glinting black eyes the size of walnuts. You try to push past it and nearly stumble into a web of threads like fishing lines, but a lot stickier. The spider edges closer, and as you get a look at the poison-dripping mandibles that could serve as swords for hurthlings, you know that this might turn out to be a fight for your life.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>30</td><td>ghul</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="ghul" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/30.png"></td><td>These undead creatures resent their return from the dead and seek to slay all living things they encounter, tempting death to reclaim them while embracing their victims. They feed on the life force and flesh of the living to slow the decaying of their own body's sallow rotting flesh.<br><br>Undead horrors that populate desecrated graveyards. They look like wizened little monkeys with long claws on the hands and sharp broken teeth in a blood-crusted mouth; their skin is a sickly gray and almost hairless, and they tear apart unburied corpses which they then eat.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>31</td><td>hill giant</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="hill giant" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/31.png"></td><td>'Hey, Bosh, I smell somet'in'. Somet'in' small and tasty.' 'How can ye even tink of food after dose ogres we just ate? I'm stuffed!' 'Maybe it's one of dose gnomes or hurthlings. We could have it as a whazit -- ye know, to settle duh tum? A digestif, dat's what dah elf called it.' 'Yeah, she *was* tasty, too. Besides, dere's always room for dessert!'<br><br>If the gods had wished to be visited by merchants, they would have given wings to the donkeys, and if they had wished the giants to brush their hair they would have given them brains so they could operate a comb. Of course, you haven't seen a winged donkey yet, and this huge humanoid has a tangled mane of hair. This race of giants is said to be a breed of overgrown but mentally retarded humans.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>32</td><td>shadow</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="shadow" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/32.png"></td><td>Dark as night, cold as ice, quiet as death, this is a shadow cast where no shadow should be. In utter silence it glides in your direction, and you feel the chill radiance of unlife as it reaches out towards your heart. A sudden weakness shudders through your frame as the shadow attacks.<br><br>The soul of a person who always chose the dark side until their personality was destroyed by their evil. All that has remained is a shadow without a body, racing across the ground while it stretches and shrinks, as if set in motion by a flickering candle. It tries to creep into the shadows of living creatures, darkening their souls and sapping the very substance from their bodies.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>33</td><td>hydra</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="hydra" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/33.png"></td><td>A solitary creature, though the idea of being alone when you have more serpentine heads than a snake pit seems hard to grasp. The creature turns its many sets of eyes in your direction. With a glint in those small pools of amber, you know that this monstrosity acts purely on instinct. And its instincts tell it, it's hungry. You ready yourself for the attack, which if even from one opponent, can come from all sides at once.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>34</td><td>troll</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="troll" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/34.png"></td><td>A huge, lumbering brute with random growths of hair on its arms and chest, and two small horns poking out of its head. It walks slightly hunched over, its pointy teeth visible as it mutters crankily to itself.<br><br>If a wicked clawed hand rips off your arm, then clonks you over the head with it, you're entirely too close to a troll. Fortunately, the offensive smell and the fact that trolls don't ever bother to sneak up on someone make sure that a troll generally only comes too close if you let it near you. They've been specifically designed for fighting: massive claws on the arms, a thick leathery skin, sharp teeth and horns, huge muscles and no inconvenient brain cells getting in the way.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>35</td><td>cave tiger</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="cave tiger" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/35.png"></td><td>Shiny fur, majestic movements and impressive fangs -- a cave tiger on the prowl is an awe-inspiring sight. Unfortunately, the prey it is after could be *you*. If your speed and dexterity aren't up to the marks, you'll probably feel sharp tiger claws ripping your armor to pieces. You can try to gain time by feeding a hungry cave tiger. (Do cats eat bats? Now's the time to find out!) However, before you draw your sword of sharpness, please consider that cave tigers belong to a very rare species. Do you really want to be responsible for their extinction?</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>36</td><td>stone giant</td><td align="center" style="background: url(../gfx/adom/maps/dungeon/floors/floor_1.png)  center"><img alt="stone giant" src="../gfx/adom/NPC/36.png"></td><td>This solemn, massive figure seems as eternal and unchanging as the granite beneath your feet. Its great size conveys a sense of quiet strength. Slow to anger, but slow to forgive, the stone giant seeks peace but finds only strife. Its tranquility has been disturbed; its home has been invaded. Now it seeks to restore its habitat the only way it can: by destroying the ones who have trespassed into its domain.</td><td>This huge humanoid has stone gray skin, and she really is made from stone. Before any other living being was created, the elder gods shaped this race from the rock of the ancient mountains. Since all stone and rock is made of their substance, these giants feel all the pain that is caused to the earth, and share its suffering. When the gods descended to the world and erected stone temples, the giants of stone arose and so great was their wrath that the gods had to strike an alliance with the demons to protect their abodes. Since those days, the giants have grown weary of the world, and most sleep deep within the mountains and only a few wake and try to effect vengeance on those torturing the earth, their mother.</td>

They are known to summon large packs of wolves when attacking, as well as using their powerful jaws and sharp teeth. They supposedly retain their thick body fur when in humanoid form.</td><td>This human has a lot of dark hair all over her body, unusually strong nails and disconcerting yellow eyes. She moves with the natural grace of a hunter and the hairy ears seem to twitch. Suddenly she throws back her head and emits a fearsome howl - and the call is answered!</td>

It also has very strong teeth and impressively muscled jaws, and it doesn't seem too friendly. An old saying claims that where the wolves howl, there also the orcs prowl, but in fact it's the other way round: areas plagued by orcs often provide a good habitat for wolves, as humans and gnomes no longer hunt them and there often is a fair share of wolf food left after orc attacks; generally, wolves despise the cowardish orcs and never fight as their allies.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>

Its touch is dangerous as any life can feed the lich's need to force life upon itself in spite of the passage of time.<br><br>A powerful magician who came back from the dead as an undead horror of sorcerous might. The flesh has rotted from the bones and the robes are threadbare, but the figure is cloaked in a shroud of eerie light that sucks at your soul. This abomination has dug up the remains of some unfortunate dead to fuel its perilous enchantments and the stench of putrefaction rises from the bones and flesh that seem to melt away under bony fingers.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>

Rearing to a massive eight feet, the creature's owl-like head gazes down on you. Its bright yellow eyes, which seem calm and wise, yet full of rage at the same time, follow your movements. With razor sharp claws, and a beak that can bite through metal, it starts towards you with a menacing screech.

The perfectly proportioned frame is clothed in a clean white robe that hangs perfectly still even as the slayer seems to float across the ground. She radiates a purity and heartless justice from beyond this world, making all her surroundings look dirty, misshaped and disorderly. Her stern look beholds you and you sense that you are being judged, and feel utterly filthy. Have you been naughty... or nice?</td>

It stands slightly taller than most of the others, with what you could almost call muscles beneath its dirty brown and flea infested fur. Its canine eyes show a glimmer of intelligence, and its ears twitch and turn, listening for a threat to its pack. A simple and poorly made hide vest covers its body, and a bow is slung over one shoulder. Primitive arrows are held in a quiver on its back. Not the kind of dog you'd want curled up at your feet, unless he was dead, by your hand.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>

It looks as if it had attained chieftain status through many bloody challenges and battles. Its tough skin is covered in coarse, dark brown fur, speckled with nasty scars and dirt. Its mixed armor is well worn and bloody, looking as if it had been torn from the former leader's still warm corpse. The face of the kobold displays not much more than cunning possessed only by the toughest of canines, ears that have been cut many times and are always at attention, eyes that never stop moving yet always seem still, and a mouth that is stuck in a perpetual scowl, with sharp, broken teeth barely showing, as if to issue a challenge to any foolish usurper. A long wooden bow is slung over one shoulder, and a quiver of wicked arrows is strapped to its back. By far the nastiest, and probably most intelligent, of the dog-warriors. But that's still not saying much...</td><td>&nbsp;</td>

Many old scars riddle his tough green skin, many skulls of various shapes and sizes hang from his belt. His face is an intelligent one, for a hobgoblin. Calculating eyes bore into your skull, and his large pointed ears seem to twitch in anticipation of a fresh challenge. Practically oozing hate from his large pores, his only seeming goal to command his tribe to further victory and spoils of battle. He carries himself as one who would slit your throat first, and ask questions later. </td><td>&nbsp;</td>

Large orcs are a crossbreed between orcs and ogres. They inherited the strength of the ogres, the toughness of the orcs and the stupidity of both. Most armor won't fit them, so generally they will stick to furs. As for weapons: the bigger the better! Orogs are often used as bodyguards by the orc chieftains.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>

He is the strongest, best armed and armored orc around. He also has the greatest battle experience, since he is constantly challenged by his peers. But, you may also see the glimmer of a sharp mind in his red eyes, for here strength often couples with cunning. Then be very afraid! Orc chieftains always get the first and best pick from the loot, so they will have the best things an orc wants to use. That does not have anything to do with the stuff you want.</td><td>She's the one who knows how to keep a gang of a dozen orcs together. The key is violence and cruelty as well as always finding some occupation for the band so they don't go at one another's throat. She's a tad bit stronger and better equipped than the others, and unlike most of this race she seems to act deliberately. If you fall into the claws of her company, she might even keep her underlings from killing you - because she can think of something nastier that could be done to you.</td>

If you think you can best this gnoll you should be aware that its warriors are not far off.<br><br>This is the kind of person who thinks that skinning people alive is fun and considers it good manners to bite the head off someone who bows in reverence.

He is clearly a master of his trade, but what that trade entails is not immediately clear; probably making decisions and enforcing them upon the strongest and most recalcitrant of arena competitors. He seems highly aware, spotting minor details that many others would overlook, a useful skill in one who might be called upon to judge a contest of speedy weapons and magical deception.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>

Still, she remains unperturbed by the joy and the madness, for she's found a purpose for her life.

Nonetheless a number of small scars reveals a former life of hardship, filled with mortal danger. The eyes appear to be sad in some mysterious way, as if grief-struck by a misery suppressed with the iron will so typical of dwarves. Despite those marks his occupation as an innkeeper seems to please him in a modest and earth-bound way one normally would not expect from an experienced adventurer.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>

Of course, when you're looking down the barrel (some prefer to call it 'mouth') of a loaded hyena, it's quite difficult to sympathize with the beast; you can hardly like jaws easily capable of biting through thighbones and a mind set to kill when this living weapon currently targets you.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>

They are very social animals who live in large families in the highlands of Ancardia. They are also very lazy and only go hunting when there is no food left, so when you meet a solitary cave lion, it will probably be very hungry. Their favorite hunting grounds are the dungeons where they can easily creep up on their prey. They certainly don't spurn the meaty taste of a careless adventurer.<br><br>Some of the teeth are broken, the sand-colored fur ridden with scars. Life in the underground is hard for this large feline, yet it has shown the strength to survive.

The malicious glint in the eyes, the broad bright red tongue and the glinting teeth display the draconian heritage, and as any dragon, it's not well disposed towards you.

Your breath condenses in the air and you feel like you're getting a cold. The leathery wings are immense, but they're frozen to the body and icicles hang from the membranes. Though its incredible cold certainly makes it a formidable opponent, the dragon doesn't seem too comfortable with its situation.

Its mouth is fixed in a hideous gaping grin, belching fire.<br><br>An undead creature clad in steel armor, the decayed hands replaced by heavy maces with sharp flanges and spikes. The hate of the undead against the living makes its attacks a lot more directed than the mechanical unemotional actions of golems.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>

His head is crowned by a foppish hat with an enormous green plume. It seems to fit in a very appropriate way considering his foppish chin beard and his finely trimmed mustache.

In times long past, the god with the head of the jackal was the master and protector of the West, the Realm the Sun passed during the night, populated by the souls of the dead who had been tried on the scales and were found just. Eventually, belief dwindled and the power of the god withdrew from this world; only in the old centers and foci of belief, where some of the old magic persists, he can take the shape in which he once was worshipped.

Their magical diet also offers them some resistance to magic used against them.<br><br>A bloodshot eye, floating in the air. Merely looking at it makes you feel exhausted.

Surprisingly cunning, incredibly strong and very experienced they are rumored to lead dozens of ogre tribes according to some greater horrible scheme. Ogre emperors are selected in brutal trial combats among the kings. Those entering these trials either die or win, so that you can expect only the most powerful and cruel ogre kings ever to aspire to this mighty position.

These huge creatures suffer a lot from the inadequacy of their new environment. As they never seem to find enough minerals and metals to keep themselves fed, they are constantly in a very bad mood and attack everything that moves. At some point in the past giant rust monsters seem to have undergone a magical transformation of some kind. They are a lot stronger and more cunning compared to the various lesser rust monsters. Additionally they sport four tentacles (instead of the usual two) on their head, which rust everything they manage to touch.<br><br>You could sense this creature through half the dungeon, simply by the way your polished metal equipment slowly seems to tarnish and corrode even as you near it. It needs a lot of metal to support its bulk, and perceives you as a large heap of food with some insignificant meat strewn in.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>

Their incredible hatred of all living has allowed them to rise to the top of the undead hierarchy. Ghost kings seem to rule their lesser brethren through sheer force of will and dark magics unknown to the living. They seem to engage in elaborate schemes to win mortal souls and bring suffering and damnation on all living beings. Ghost kings are fading images of figures in royal garb. They emanate a cold, chilling light of yellow color and their eyes burn in a fiery red flame. Their voice is a chilling rasp, known to send waves of cold through all listeners.<br><br>The restless soul of a person who died long ago which won't find peace even when the last star fades. It has come to envy the living and despise itself and the world over the eons, and these emotions condense into a legendary power of absorbing life and giving death. Yet most that wither and die due to its touch will return as ghosts, too, leaving it naught but the questionable benefit of company in misery.</td><td>&nbsp;</td>

Is it the strange cunning in the eyes that seem to glow with their own light? Or is it the fact that the head doesn't bear mandibles but a bunch of writhing black tentacles?</td><td>&nbsp;</td>

Their lords are descended from the most powerful of the ancient high wolves, filled with terrible power and cunning beyond belief.<br><br>This man has learnt to run with the wolves, and they have accepted him as leader of the pack.

Skeletal kings possess great power, being capable of bringing the corpses of fallen enemies under their control. Some ancient documents also mention their capacity for magic.
