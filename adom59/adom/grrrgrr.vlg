YOUR HISTORY:
        Your parents are traveling adventurers. They are doing moderately
 well but are talented enough to survive.
        During your childhood one of your uncles taught you a lot of things
 about the history of your people. Your vast knowledge on the legends and
 the lore of your people made you very popular with your friends because of
 all the exciting stories you knew.
        During your youth you had a lot of fun playing with other kids of
 your age. You always were a natural leader and the center of interest.
        As a young adult you had to work a lot to finance your
 apprenticeship. You were often tired and exhausted but all this was
 forgotten, when you finally achieved your goal.
        You decided to become a Ranger.
